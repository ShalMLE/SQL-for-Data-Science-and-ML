# SQL for Data Science and ML

# SQL for Data Science & Machine Learning

This repository showcases a structured, 3-day SQL learning and implementation plan focused on the SQL skills required for **Data Scientist**, **Machine Learning Engineer**, and **Analytics** roles.  
It includes hands-on exercises, dataset cleaning, window functions, business analytics, A/B testing, and ML-ready feature engineering.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate **practical SQL proficiency** through real, production-style workflows used in DS/ML.

## 🔍 Why SQL Matters for DS/ML Roles

Data Scientists and ML Engineers spend 50–70% of their time:
- Extracting data  
- Cleaning and standardizing datasets  
- Creating analytical and ML features  
- Preparing training-ready datasets  
- Analyzing product performance (A/B tests)  

This repository demonstrates **all these skills** through hands-on SQL projects.
